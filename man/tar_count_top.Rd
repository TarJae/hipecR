\title{Count Top Categories in a Factor}
\usage{
tar_count_top(df, var, n = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing the variable to be manipulated.}

\item{var}{The name of the factor variable within the dataframe as a string.}

\item{n}{The number of top levels to keep before lumping others into 'Other'; default is 5.}
}
\value{
A dataframe showing the count of each level including 'Other' for all lumped lesser categories.
}
\description{
This function transforms the specified factor variable within a dataframe to lump all but the top n most frequent levels into an 'Other' category and then computes the count of each level.
}
\details{
This function leverages `dplyr` for data manipulation and `forcats` for managing factor levels. It is particularly useful in data summarization where the focus is on the most frequent categories.
}
