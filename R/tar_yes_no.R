#' Convert "yes" and "no" to 1 and 0
#'
#' This function takes a vector and converts all instances of "yes" to 1, "no" to 0,
#' and leaves other values as NA. It's useful for converting categorical "yes"/"no"
#' responses into a numeric format that can be used in statistical analysis.
#'
#' @param x A vector containing elements to be converted. Elements should be
#'   character strings potentially including "yes" and "no".
#'
#' @return A numeric vector where "yes" is replaced with 1, "no" with 0, and
#'   other values with NA.
